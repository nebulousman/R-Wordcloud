                                                      better player than I thought you were."    
         TONY LA RUSSA                                        So  not  a  player,  not  a  manager.    It  got 
                                                      better later, but I open by telling you how much I 
                                                      understand and pressure what this means.  But I 
        TONY  LA  RUSSA:    Good  afternoon.    I   want   to   add,   since   December,   have   not   been 
remember   in   December   when   the   news   came   comfortable with it.  
about  the  election,  and  the  excitement  of  joining      And, in fact, I started to never even think it 
Bobby and Joe, the meaning of that, and then in   was realistic until we got to 2,000 wins and there 
January, Tom, Greg and  Frank, it's gotten  better   was some conversation, and then winning in 2006, 
and  better.    And  I  thought,  you  know,  when  it   there was more talk about it.  
comes   time   to   speak,   I've   got   an   important      But     nothing's     really     changed     about 
message to deliver about how I feel, and I think I   accepting  this  personally.    And  I  want  to  try  to 
can do it.                                            explain what I mean.  
        And then this afternoon, we're in the room            From managing parts of two years in the 
waiting to come on the bus, and all of a sudden I   Minor  Leagues,  after  thinking  about  all  the  other 
started to feel differently.  Then you ride the bus   young  managers  who  pay  a  lot  of  dues  in  the 
out here, see the guys get on the bus and you're   Minor Leagues, and I get a chance after parts of 
surrounded by the Hall of Famers and it starts to   two years; and then I go into the big leagues with 
get tougher.  Then you see the crowd when  you   three    organizations,    Chicago    White    Sox,    the 
arrive, and it is real tough.                         Oakland A's and St. Louis Cardinals, and truthfully 
        But one thing for certain, all of that buildup   can tell you, never had one day that the coaches, 
for certain has created a total understanding and   anybody on our staff and myself, felt that we didn't

Hall of Fame.  It's uncomfortable because I didn't            I don't know any other manager, especially 
make it as a player, not even close, and even my   one  that's  managed  30-plus  years,  can  get  that 
early   days   as   a  manager;  there   were   some   kind  of  vote  of  confidence.    All  I  know,  all  that 
moments where this could never happen.                equates  to  me  is,  very,  very  fortunate,  and  the 
        I remember Paul Richards introduced me   more  I  thought  about  it  and  think  about  it,  I've 
to my first Minor League  club  in  Knoxville to the   never put my arms around the fact that being really

you're  wondering  about  this  boy  that's  going  to   you're going to say, and I know where I need to

ballpark at 12 o'clock or earlier, you come back at   them are back there, Rickie and Eck, and on those 
midnight.    Mentally  you're  not  even  home  when   teams,  there's a lot of flash and dash and  bash.  
you're home.  And somehow, my wife has made   But  we  played  the  game  really  hard,  really  well 
this work; and our two children, I'll tell you, at any   every day, because we had three guys that led our 
time, any of the three could have said, it's enough   ballclub and would not allow it to be different.  On 
of you and it's about us, and they allowed me to do   the  infield  side,  Carney  Lansford,  outfield  Dave 
it, going too early and staying too late.              Henderson   and   from   the   pitching   staff,   Dave 
        So Elaine, thank you.                          Stewart.  
        You    know,    Paul    Richards    once    said,       Communication was such a key.  I used to 
"When you manage, you'll never have a completely   communicate with Stew just by listening to him and 
happy day."  I didn't believe that.                    doing what he said.  Except one time, he's getting 
        I  said,  "How  about   you   win  the  World   beat  up and  Stew took the mound like the  great 
Series?"                                               starters  here  and  other  great  No. 1s,  want  the 
        "You'll   never   have   a   completely   happy   game and it's theirs until the bitter end or game’s 
day."  And there’s a couple things about today.        end.  
        For  one,  because  of  all  the  animals  at           Stew is getting beat up, a lot of doubles in 
home and other commitments, Bianca and Devon   the gap, we are watching cutoffs and relays, and 
are not here.  That does not make me happy.            there's one to left field, left center, he's got his back 
        The  other  one  is  that  when  you  manage   to the dugout.  And I come get him, finally.  Get to 
three  places,  a  lot  of  great  people,  everybody   the mound and he turns, and says, "What are you 
should   get   recognized   and   there's   no   way   to   doing here?"  
mention everybody, and that bothers me.                         I says, "Stew, I got to get you."    
        But I'm going to do the best I can, because             He says, "Why?  I'm not tired." 
these organizations were so special.  I think about   I said, "Yeah, but our outfielders are."    (Laughter.) 
the  Chicago  White  Sox,  you  saw  the  highlights,           Then  we  go  to  St. Louis,  and  you've  got 
first   time   since   1959   that   a   baseball   team   in   that tradition, that history, so spectacular.  You had 
Chicago had won, a wonderful experience.               Hall of Famers walking around like Red and Stan 
        And  with  the  White  Sox,  we  all  this  had   in the 40s and 50s, and you go to the 60s and you 
unique opportunity for two years, and maybe the   have Bob and Lou, and later in the 80s you've got 
best example, I think it was August, September in   Ozzie,  you've  got Whitey,  you've  got  Sutter,  and 
New  York  against  the  Yankees.    Tom  Seaver  is   you feel this obligation to go forward.  
going for his 300th win, Hall of Famer Pudge Fisk               And    from    day    one,    I    think    with    the 
is catching him, and to be part of that, to watch him   ownership we had there, we were really motivated 
shut   them   out --  not   shut   them   out,   pitch   a   to    be    caretakers,    same    situation,    wonderful 
complete game, we won 4-2, 5-2, I don't know for   leadership,  a  complete  package  of  trying  to  put 
sure, because fifth inning, I got ejected, a la Bobby   players in a position to win.  And a  player that I 
Cox.                                                   know will be here very soon, or hopefully not very 
        But I got to watch from the runway, and I'm   soon, but sometime, Albert Pujols.  
thinking about ‘83 and ‘84 and '85 with Pudge and               So I think about the beginning and end of 
Tom,  and  I  think  about   what   you  learn   about   their career, and it's overwhelming.  
leadership from teammates.  In '83 we had Jerry                 When I put all that together, here again, I 
Dybzinski and Jerry Koosman, classic leaders.          feel very, very fortunate.  
        We   had   a   young   star   named   Harold            Another  part  of  that  fortune   was  being 
Baines, a lot like Tony, if he could have kept his   around a man named George Kissell.  This is one 
knees together, he would have well into 3,000 hits.    of  the  most  important  things  I  wanted  to  share.  
        Then  you go Oakland, and  you have the   The   last   year   that   I   tried   to   play,   I   was   a 
same combination of Chicago and St. Louis.  You   player/coach, and then I wanted to try to manage.  
had    the    wonderful    ownership,    they    are    all   We didn't have kids so we agreed, let's try it.  
represented  here  today.    You  had  a  great  front 

                                                                                                                2

        And George said, "Here is my advice.  And   industry  and  there's  one  guy  that  I  talk  to  more 
if you can't do these two things, don't try it."   He   than ever over the years, sometimes three or four 
says, "If you want to manage or coach, you've got   times  a  week  for  30  years,  we  compared  in  an 
to love the game and you've got to want to learn it."     honest   way,   and   I   think   for   one   of   the   great 
        And   like   all   of   us   who   knew   George,   baseball mind and managers of any generation out 
everything George said, we did.  And I will tell you   there, Jim Leyland, thank you, Jim.  
that  for  the  next  35,  36  years,  it  was  all  about       I'll   wrap   up   the   coaching   part,   not   to

the   many   mentors   and   coaches,   not   just   in   really valued their teaching and their importance to 
baseball but in other sports; I look down and I see   try and build a winning situation.  
one  represented,  Coach  Bill  Parcells,  thanks  for           And    I    have  to    mention    that    I    think 
being here, Coach.                                      offensively,   for   many   years,   the   presence   of

and  had  a  very,  very  strong  baseball  and  family          On the pitching side, I know Leo is a great 
introduction to our game.                               coach, I don't disrespect -- I'll say nobody has ever

you could have in all respects and I like to tell her   asked me the other day, what do you think he was 
she's my favorite sister and she's my only sister,   worth.    I  said,  “we  got  2,700  wins.    It's  in  the 
Eva,  and  our  relatives  there,  cousins  and  nieces   hundreds, 500, 600,  700,  if we  didn't have Dunc 
and nephews, a lot of friends and teammates from   since '83, you can subtract hundreds of wins.”  We 
Tampa, thanks for being here.                           have   Dave   McKay,   Pepitone,   representing   the 
        But   loving   and   learning.      That's   what   coaching community.  Thank you, fellas, for what 
carried us, and what else has been learned.             you've done. 
        I learned after retiring from Major League               Just a couple other things about learning.  
Baseball, and I learned, when you were in a team,   I  think  leadership  is  more  important  than  ever  in 
you're in a little cocoon and I had two great years   baseball.  Because of free agency and guaranteed 
plus a little bit learning about just the immensity of   contracts and guys seeking fame and fortune, they 
Major   League   Baseball   and   how   many   great   grew up kind of entitled, it's more important than 
people work there.                                      ever  that  the  people  that  are  trying  to  put  in  a 
        And since I study leadership, I'm going to   position to win have real leadership skills and really 
tell you, the man that's leaving has been a great   work  at  it.    You've  got  to  fight  through  those 
leader, and I've learned from Commissioner Selig,   distractions  and  the  distorted  ideas  about  what's 
and  like  many,  we  don't  want  to  leave  and  he's   right.  
going to leave and we want to commend you for                    So with our team, we really taught that to 
the work you've done.                                   combine with talent, there were three T's:   team, 
        I also, because I  went back in the game   tenacity  and  toughness.    We  really  worked  on 
recently,   you   had   that   little   gut   feeling   about   those and I can honestly say that over the years, 
wanting       to       compete       and       the       Arizona   through   the   great   work   of   our   coaching   staff, 
Diamondbacks  have  given  me  that  opportunity,   trainers  like Barry Weinberg and Herb  Schneider 
and today I've been distracted trying to figure out   and  our  equipment  men,  I  know  Buddy  Bates  is 
what's  happening  in  Philadelphia.    I  hope  we're   here; Steve Vucinich, I think we helped create that.  
beating  the  Phillies.    And  if  anybody  can  Tweet          But I have one pet peeve.  For years, I've 
that or whatever or send me a text, let me know if   heard,   Tony's   prepared,   our   team's   prepared.  
we're winning.  If we're losing, don't do it.           Preparing is just studying for the time at the time.  I 
        But I think about what you've learned and I   think what our teams did was we took the test.  We 
think   about   conversations   over   the   years,   like   competed like fanatics, every day, all the time, in 
Coach  Parcells,  you  do  that  with  people  in  your 

                                                                                                                  3

the right way, and if somebody beat us, we tipped 
our caps and when we won, we felt good about it.  
        So with all that said, we did embrace the 
pressure   and   the   expectations   of   the   different 
places, but here is the bottom line:  Nothing really 
has changed about my personal feeling.  I am not 
comfortable   on   the   stage   personally,   but   I   do 
believe I've finally come up to a resolution.  
        I was in three great situations, great, with 
great coaches, great people around, been taught.  
And I believe the way to accept this tremendous 
honor is as a representative of all those mentors, 
coaches and members of the Chicago White Sox, 
Oakland A's and St. Louis Cardinals.  Thank you.
