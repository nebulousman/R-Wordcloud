# R-Wordcloud
This fun project creates a wordcloud of common words used by inductees to MLB Hall Of Fame in their speeches. Transcripts of speeches were shared by the reference librarian of the HOF. Files were shared in pdf format and needed to be converted to txt files. A few samples are in the speeches folder for testing.

The output will look something like this:
